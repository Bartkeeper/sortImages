# sortImages

This file sorts your images based on the filename's timestamp and copies them into Year/Month folders. 

Please be aware that it only contains basic functions and that your entries MUST be correct in order to have a successful processing.

In my next step i will add an exception-handling that will avoid incorrect processing.

If you have questions or hints how my programm could be improved, just send me a message.
